# **Slot Machine App**

Slot Machine App, is a Python terminal app that runs on Heroku.

Slot Machine App is a replication of gambling slot machine with a text based application.

This App allows a user to have some entertainment and spend his/ her spaire time.

## How to use the App

* User is asked to enter an amount he/ she would like to deposit to start the game
* it  confirms the balance and get a reconfirmation to contiune the game asking to press enter to continue or "q" to quit
* Then user is asked to enter the number of line to be bet in the range of 1-3
* After that the user shall decide on the bet per line with the ceiling of $ 200
* IT reconfirms the amount per line, number of lines and total bet
* The results deplay to the user along with winning or losing results followed by available current available balance.
* Again, requst for a confirmation for a contiunation
* If deciced to quit, thanking note is displayed while requeting to collect the balance amount.


## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

Target Audience â€“ Adults (above 18) who are interested in stimulating gambling environment for entertaintment and spend spair time 

As a User I want to:
* User friendly app with ease of navigation
* spend some free time for entertainment purpose 

### User Experience in this Game
The app stimulates a gambling enviroment that user can enjoy

## Features




### Future Development & Features Left to Implement

* This is only proof of concept version of this app.
* In future versions I plan to implement different options including:

    - Get financial instruments from a more reliable data source, ex: [Nasdaq Data Link]( https://data.nasdaq.com/)  
    - Ability to get data and group by different sectors, sub sectors.
    - Ability to select custom time interval for performance.
    - Ability to display data , ex: using [Matplotlib]( https://matplotlib.org/)( see section wireframes)
    - Ability for alerts when a specific condition on a specific list of instruments is met.
    - Ability to have the alerts sent to user via different methods, ex: Email, Telegram, Discord.


### Data Model Design

**Use Case Diagram and Flow Control**

A combination of Flow Control and Unified Modelling Language (UML) was used to visualize the various features and control flow statements of the app.

* The Diagram was drafted to capture the app's functionality and relationships with the user.

* The relationship with the User starts at Welcome screen. All 6 screens of the app are represented by orange squares. The relation between screens are represented by arrows with numbers which represent navigation options. 
* The Diagram shows the order in which individual instructions were executed and the result that followed.

* This also allowed the design of the user input validation checks to be visually clear before the code was written.

![Use Case Diagram](documentation/wireframes/diagram.png)

**Wireframes**

Wireframes were drawn to have the basic idea of what needs to be build.

![Main](documentation/wireframes/main.jpg)
![ETF](documentation/wireframes/etf.jpg)

**Future Development Wireframes**

As discussed in Future Development section above, this is a potential development in the future.

![Future](documentation/wireframes/future.jpg)

**Classes and functions**

* During the development in order to minimize redundant code I decided to group various if statements into functions and then into a class called *Crawler*. The class diagram below shows what class does.
The class and its associated methods are stored in separate file to allow for separating the code into parts that hold related data and functionality.  
 
* List with tickers and ETFs were extracted to external file called *constants*.   
* Some functions were also moved to an eternal file called *functions* to make the code more modular.
* This will allow any future expansion and development of this project to have a clear structure and also for any code re-use and sharing as well as maintenance.

**Colour**

To change the text color [Termcolor](https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/) was imported.  

A mix of red and green was used to keep the app intuitive give feedback to the Users. 

## Libraries & Technology Used

**Python Libraries**
* pip 

    pip install was used to install Python Libraries via terminal using the command `pip install 'package name'` to install packages in gitpod.
    
    The command `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` was used to install dependencies for proper deployment on heroku. 
* os

    The os library was imported to create a function to utilize the os.system to clear the terminal.  This supports a positive user experience and making the screen clearer and more structured.
    
* time and datetime 

    Time and Datetime was used for calculating the time periods and in animation function.
    
* tabulate

    Was used to display the data in a table format.
    
* Yahoo Finance (yfinance)

    yfinance was used to get the data for financial instruments from Yahoo Finance website
    
* pandas 
    
    pandas dataframe was used to manipulate the data.
    
* numpy 

    numpy was used for adding the percent (%) sign to the calculated data before displaying.
    
* art
    
    was used to generate ASCII art for the title of the app.

* [LucidCharts](https://www.lucidchart.com/) was used to create the UML Case Diagram and the Flowchart.

* [Draw.io](https://www.Draw.io) to draw Class Diagram.

* Snagit to convert, edit, crop and save images screen recordings.

## Testing
*   Methods such as print() as the code developed was used to check for errors.  This helped check that everything was behaving as expected.

*   Errors or warnings were fixed as they appeared such as indentation errors, lines too long or extra space issues.  This helped keep the code clean and readable so other errors or bugs that arose were identified more easily.

*   After deployment all features were checked on Chrome, Firefox, Brave and Edge.

*   The app was deployed early on in development and checked regularly to ensure app working corectly and any errors were handled early on.

*   Testing inputs were used to ensure user inputs would be handled correctly and appropriate feedback to the user was shown on screen.  As mentioned above in the Features Section for how user inputs were handled.

    *   Welcome screen:
    This will accept any input before the enter key is pressed, but makes no use of any input apart from the enter key which calls the main menu function.

    *   App Navigation:
    To test, keys from 1 to 4 from Main menu and 0 to 4 from sub-menus were pressed resulting in navigation to that specific page. Any other input results in `Invalid choice !!!` error message being displayed.

    *   Percent change:
    To test that is calculated correctly the entire dataframe for the specific period was printed to the terminal and then manually calculating the percent change using Windows calculator.

    *   Find by ticker:
    
           To test the input and return of this function steps were as follow:
           - Numbers 0 to 4 were inputted - resulting in Navigation to that specific page -> works as intended.
           - Negative and bigger than 4 numbers were inputted - results in `Invalid choice !!!` error message -> works as intended.
           - Up to 5 letters being inputted and ticker found - displays ticker info -> works as intended.
           - Up to 5 letters being inputted and ticker not found -  results in `Ticker info not found !!!` error message -> works as intended.
           - Non alphanumeric being inputted - results in `You need to input Alphanumeric characters !!!` error message -> works as intended.
           - More than 5 letters being inputted - results in `Ticker should be up to 5 letters !!!` error message -> works as intended.
           - A catch all error clause for unpredictable user inputs was added to prevent the app crashing from *inventive* users:
           
           ![Catch all](documentation/features/all.jpg)
           
  
 
### Bugs Found

**1.  Fetch error:**

During development, incorrectly specifying the date resulted in getting False values in the dataframe.

![Fetch error](documentation/errors/fetch_error.jpg)

It was solved by looking at [examples](https://towardsdatascience.com/financial-data-from-yahoo-finance-with-python-b5399743bcc6) on how to query `yfinance` to get the data for specific time period.




**2.  Index error**

During code refactoring a duplication/addition of table indexes occurred when navigating between pages:

![Index error](documentation/errors/index_error.jpg)

It was fixed by adding `.copy()` at the end of the line. 

![Index error](documentation/errors/index_error_fix.jpg)



**3. Transpose error**

*  During development while trying to add the 2nd and 3rd list of ETFs run into a key error:  


![Transpose error](documentation/errors/transpose_error.jpg)
![Transpose error](documentation/errors/transpose_error_code.jpg)

was fixed by building a separate function for it:

     def __init__(self, tickers, ticker_names):
            """
            Check and formats the data
            """
            self.tickers = tickers if isinstance(
                tickers, (list, set, tuple)) else tickers.replace(',', ' ').split()
            self.ticker_names = ticker_names


![Transpose error](documentation/errors/transpose_error_fix.jpg)

**4. Period error**

Since the app was developed during the weekdays an unpredictable error occurred while using the app in the weekend.
Good that error handling message pinpointed where is the problem: `Something bad happened while processing data!`, it was in the class Crawler.
Financial markets are closed during weekend, hence there is no data. While refactoring `today = date.today()` was used to calculate previous period. It works for all periods except for the previous day. Therefore the code to calculate previous day was reverted to the version before refactor in order to work properly.  
In the the future code may be refactored to handle this exception but for time being it is working as intended.

![Period error](documentation/errors/period_error.jpg)
![Period error](documentation/errors/period_error_code.jpg)

And this is the fix:

![Period error](documentation/errors/period_error_fix.jpg)


### Validator Testing

[pep8 online](http://pep8online.com/) was used for validating the python files.  All python files were checked with no errors reported.
